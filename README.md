# HopperSort
A Paper plugin that adds sorting hoppers into the game, this allows for a sorting system without
using any redstone.

This plugin was inspired by the [Copper Hopper](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/copper-hopper) mod.

### How to use
The sorting hopper will only pickup items that are already in the hopper, and the hopper will never let the
last item in the hopper go out, this is to prevent the hopper from being empty.
